Node.js Notes:
--------------

-Non-blocking I/O
-Supports tens of thousands concurrent connections.
Optimises throughout and scalability in web applications with many I/O operations



Node is on a single threaded - which means it can it waits for events to happen.


Difference between Synchronous and Asynchrous:
----------------------------------------------
Synchronous - means that you will have to wait for one thing at a time.

Asynchrous - Can execute multiple things at a time and don't have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to the next.


NPM: Node Package Manager
----

- Used to install node programs / modules.

node install <name of package>

install it on your system:
node install -g <name of packages>


package.json File:
------------------

- really important file, which is used in node packages and applications. It goes in the root, it tells npm how the package is structured and how to run it.

To get package.json run "npm init"

package.json Example:
{
    "name": "exampleapp",
    "version": 1.0.0",
    "description": "Simple Task Manager",
    "main": "server.js",
    "author": "James Jones",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
        "body-parser": "^1.15.2",
        "express": "^4.14.0",
        "mongojs": "^2.4.0"
    }
}



Expresss:
---------
If we wanted to install the Node Express Module, we can write npm install express or npm install -g express (makes express global)

when we install node programs it will install into the "node_modules" folder.
